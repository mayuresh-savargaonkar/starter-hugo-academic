abstract: The increase in the demand for electricity in commercial areas is going up by the day. The recent few years have shown a lot of growth in the commercialâ€“express feeder consumers. Consequently, the need for energy is going up. Thus to satiate the demand, the utility company needs to produce more electricity, hence increasing the economics. To cope up with the rising cost and escalating demand of electricity we have come up with an indigenous solution. This solution aims at fulfilling electricity demand of the stated consumers by domestically generating electricity. Along with satisfying the demand for electricity of the consumer, a solution for exporting excessively generated electricity to the power grid has also been developed. The power thus generated is at a lower cost as compared to the commercial utility company tariff. This is accomplished with the use of micro steam turbine, its accessories and boiler. Conclusively providing a self-sufficient and profit path to the stated consumer.
