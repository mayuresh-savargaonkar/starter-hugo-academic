## Overview

Interesting article by Wall Street Journal on the list of crashes suspected to be related to ADAS features.

As more vehicles are sold with Driver Assistance features, unknown failures are on the rise. The "curse of dimensionality" critically limits our abilities to dive into the unknown of unknowns! 

Many questions remain-

- How do we test AI algorithms in these features ?
- Can synthetic data help ?
- How realistic are the current safety metrics?
- How to verify and validate ? Is ISO 21448 / UL 4600 enough?
- Can we develop, use and exploit V2I and V2V communications?

One thing is certain- we need to critically accelerate the learning from such incidents. How to do that is the pressing question!
