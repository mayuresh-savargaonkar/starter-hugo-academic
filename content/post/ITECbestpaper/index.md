Excited to announce that our team has been awarded the Best Student Paper at the 2023 IEEE Transportation Electrification Conference & Expo (ITEC) üèÜ.

Kudos to Wael Hassanieh for leading this paper. We continue to make vital contributions to our research on deep orthogonal encodings for long-term forecasting, a crucial step forward in pre-deployment battery cell quality assessment!
