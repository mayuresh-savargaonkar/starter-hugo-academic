I want to thank the University of Michigan-Dearborn for recognizing me as a 2022 Difference Maker! I am the only graduate student winner for this year! I am truly humbled and honored to receive this prestigious award. I am deeply grateful to my advisor Professor Abdallah Chehade for his positive and continuous guidance.

My research on the safety of autonomous and connected vehicles is creating a difference! I try explaining some aspects in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=liHkUn6GrnE).

About the award:

Annually UM-Dearborn selects student Difference Makers who are at the forefront of their fields. Nominated by faculty and staff, these individuals aren't just outstanding students and alumni, they embody academic and professional achievement, integrity and leadership.

Go Blue! Go Dearborn!
